# Puzzle Box

This is the code that I developed with a team during a Hack-a-thon at Brigham Young University - Idaho. This was my first semester, and I was just learning the basis of programming on Python at the moment.
This was my first experience programming something for the real life, and also working on C++

The code is able to execute everything, with exception of the pins.
